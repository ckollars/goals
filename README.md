## Concrete 2016 goals

* [ ] Read 40 new books (3/40)*
* [ ] Hike 10 new trails (0/10)
* [ ] Go camping 3 times (0/3)

\* Some people think I am trying to read 40 novel-length books. Nope. "Books" includes anything I would already track in Goodreads, like trade-paperback-length comics and graphic novels. Does not, however, include individual comic issues (because that's just cheating).

* [ ] Lights out by 11:30, every work night (1/20)
* [ ] Exercise 17 times (0/17)
* [ ] Log 20 hours learning Japanese (0/20)
* [ ] Read 3 books (0/3)
* [ ] Get BALC directory up to date
* [ ] Finish bookmarks mini-site
* [ ] Finish idea generator
