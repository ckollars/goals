## Concrete 2016 goals

* [ ] Read 40 new books (6/40)*
* [ ] Hike 10 new trails (0/10)
* [ ] Go camping 3 times (0/3)

\* Some people think I am trying to read 40 novel-length books. Nope. "Books" includes anything I would already track in Goodreads, like trade-paperback-length comics and graphic novels. Does not, however, include individual comic issues (because that's just cheating).

## Current: March 2016 goals

* [ ] Exercise 17 times (0/17)
* [ ] Read 3 books (0/3)
* [ ] Log 30 hours learning Japanese (0/20)
* [ ] Start filing taxes
* [ ] Comps for BALC redesign
* [ ] Make time for weaving every week (0/5)
